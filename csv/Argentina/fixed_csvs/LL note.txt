I downloaded a fresh file today for the period 2018-2020. this covers only 1 week of Jan, 
checked the period 2020 until Sep 2022 and the Jan week doesn't overlap.

2020_until_Sep_2022 > because it was an incomplete year, deleted the cases Jan-Sep 2022 and instead used the file Jan 2022 to Jul 2023

DECIDED NOT TO DO THIS--July_2023_to_Dec_2023 > kept only all rows from week 27 2023. this is because weeks until 26, 2023 was in the file Jan 2022 to July 2023 

2022_until_Apr_2024 > used only the full year 2023 and 2022 from this dataset
